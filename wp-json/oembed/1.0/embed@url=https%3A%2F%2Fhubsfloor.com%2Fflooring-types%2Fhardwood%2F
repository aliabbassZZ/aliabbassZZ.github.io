We have many species of wood in our showroom to include oak, maple, hickory, and many others. We also offer professional installation of all our wood options.

HomerWood\u00ae Premium Hardwood Flooring HomerWood features a wide selection of unique visuals of hardwood flooring, in both engineered and solid profiles, to offer exquisite styling and enhanced performance to any project. We allow nature to customize your floor. Crafted from the entire tree, all of nature&#8217;s beautiful, distinctive markings are preserved. In the Traditional Character Collection, these one-of-a-kind markings are highlighted beneath a smooth durable finish. Color Variation Over Time Many species of hardwood change color over time, after exposure to sunlight. The degree of change depends upon the species of the wood. For example, Cherry becomes darker and richer very quickly when exposed to sunlight; Maple follows by darkening slightly and Black Walnut lightens.
